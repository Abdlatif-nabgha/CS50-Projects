# CS50 Projects

Welcome to my CS50 Projects repository! ðŸŽ“

This repository contains all the projects, problem sets, and solutions I completed during the [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course. It showcases my learning and progress in various topics such as:

- **C Programming**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Memory Management**
- **Web Development with Flask**
- **SQL and Database Design**
- **Python Programming**

## Structure

- **Problem Sets**: Solutions to all problem sets from the course.
- **Labs**: Smaller tasks and exercises to build up programming skills.
- **Final Project**: My capstone project combining all the skills I learned during the course.

## Why CS50?

CS50 is one of the best courses for learning computer science fundamentals, and this repository is my way of documenting my growth and sharing my journey with others.

## How to Use
